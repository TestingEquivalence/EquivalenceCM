Abstract: 
Abstract We consider an equivalence test for a fully specified continuous distribution on R. 
The equivalence test is a powerful tool to show that observed data are sufficiently close to a given distribution. The test under consideration is based on the time-proven Cramér-von Mises distance. We show that the test is locally asymptotically most powerful. A consistent estimator for the asymptotic variance of the test statistic is provided. The bootstrap percentile-t method is applied to improve the finite sample performance of the equivalence test. A detailed algorithm for the asymptotic and percentile-t tests is given. An extensive simulation study of the finite sample properties is performed. A practical approach to find efficient values of the tolerance parameter is provided.
